### **Child Monitoring for the Visually Impaired**
##### Won First place at Biobytes. 

LinkUs helps visually impaired parents keep track of young children. We made a rough prototype for the 2018 UMD biobytes competition that consists of a parent and child tracker. Both trackers would respond if they got too far apart as defined by a given threshold. It uses python and leveraged arduino sensors to create an alert.
